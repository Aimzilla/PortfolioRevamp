      <h1>My Project Portfolio</h1>
      <p>
        Below are some projects I have created on my <br />
        journey to learn JavaScript. These projects <br />
        were created during classes I took on the <br />
        Skillcrush platform.

    <main>
      <section id="map">
        <h2>Interactive Election Map</h2>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          This was my third, and most recent, JavaScript project created during
          class. In this project, I delved into multi-dimensional arrays,
          populating tables statically & dynamically, and implementing
          mouse-over interactivity. Click below to see who won in your state!
        </p>

          /></a>
        </div>
      </section>

      <section id="magic-ball">
        <h2>Magic 8-ball</h2>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          This was my second JavaScript project created during class. In this
          project, I got more exposure to arrays, Math methods, and loops. Click
          below to have all the mysteries of the universe unlocked!

      </section>

      <section id="lol-cat">
        <h2>LOL Cat Clock</h2>
        <p class="project-paragraph">
          The "LOL Cat Clock" was my first class project that incorporated
          JavaScript. In this project, I became familiar with the DOM, events,
          event listeners, and some basic jQuery. Click below to see some of the
          cats of the internet in action!
